    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kelsey Schaefermeyer! I am currently pursuing a degree in Graphic Design with an emphaisis in UX/UI and a minor in Web Design and Development. </p>

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I am from Utah but have lived in La Paz, Bolivia for a good chunk of my schooling! 
       Learning about web design excites me because it allows me to blend creativity with technology. I plan to use these skills to enhance my interface designs and projects.</p>

   
    <p>What I love most about BYU-Idaho is the sense of community and the dedication to learning. The supportive environment makes it a perfect place to grow academically and spiritually.</p>


    <p>In my free time, I enjoy oil painting and pottery work. One of my favorite scriptures is Helaman 5:12 which reminds me that I will always have support from the Lord.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting my page and getting to know a little more about me!</p>
